The connection and communication between your TV and this program work primarily through the `samsungctl` Python library. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Network Connection**: Both your computer (running the `tv_remote_backend.py` program) and your Samsung TV must be connected to the same local network (e.g., your home Wi-Fi). This is essential for them to find and communicate with each other.

2.  **`samsungctl` Library**: This library acts as a bridge. It implements the specific communication protocol that Samsung TVs use for remote control over a network. For newer Samsung TVs, this often involves WebSockets, which provide a persistent, two-way communication channel.

3.  **Configuration**: In `tv_remote_backend.py`, there's a `config` dictionary where you provide your TV's IP address (`host`) and the port (which is `8001` by default for Samsung TV remote control). This information tells `samsungctl` where to find your TV on the network.

4.  **Sending Commands**:
    *   When you click a button on the web interface (`home.html`), a JavaScript function sends a command string (e.g., `KEY_VOLUP`, `KEY_POWEROFF`) to the backend server (`tv_remote_backend.py`) via an HTTP POST request.
    *   The backend receives this command.
    *   It then uses the `samsungctl.Remote(config)` object to establish a connection with your TV and calls the `.control()` method with the received command string (e.g., `remote.control("KEY_VOLUP")`).

5.  **TV's Response**: Your Samsung TV has a built-in network API that listens for these commands. When it receives a command from `samsungctl`, it interprets it as if you pressed a button on a physical remote control, and then executes the corresponding action (e.g., increasing the volume, changing the channel, powering off).

In essence, the `samsungctl` library translates the simple command strings from your web browser into the specific network messages that your Samsung TV understands and responds to.
